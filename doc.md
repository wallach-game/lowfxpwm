# Non-Blocking 5Hz PWM Generation

This code provides an implementation of non-blocking 5Hz PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal generation using Arduino. The code uses interrupts and timers to generate the PWM signal without blocking the main loop execution.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Arduino IDE or compatible software

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect a LED or any other output device to pin 13 (outPin) of the Arduino board.

## Code Explanation

### Variables

- `outPin`: The digital pin used to output the PWM signal.
- `intensity`: The intensity value used to control the PWM duty cycle.
- `timeRefHigh`: The reference time for the high pulse.
- `timeRefLow`: The reference time for the low pulse.
- `high0`: The remaining time for the current high pulse.
- `high1`: The remaining time for the current low pulse.
- `state`: The state variable indicating the current intensity range.

### `setup()`

- Initializes the serial communication for debugging purposes.
- Sets the `outPin` as an output pin.
- Sets the `outPin` to an initial HIGH state.
- Initializes the reference times for the high and low pulses.

### `loop()`

- Reads the current time (`cas`) using `millis()`.
- Calculates the remaining time for the current high pulse (`high0`) and low pulse (`high1`).
- Prints `high1` to the serial monitor for debugging.
- Calls the `timers()` function.

### `timers()`

- Checks if the remaining time for the current high pulse (`high0`) is less than or equal to 0.
  - If true, updates the reference time for the high pulse (`timeRefHigh`) to the current time using `millis()`.
  - Sets the `outPin` to LOW to start the high pulse.
  - Checks the `state` variable and performs an expensive operation if `state` is equal to 2.
- Checks if the remaining time for the current low pulse (`high1`) is less than or equal to 0.
  - If true, updates the reference time for the low pulse (`timeRefLow`) to the current time using `millis()`.
  - Sets the `outPin` to HIGH to start the low pulse.
  - Performs an expensive operation based on the `state` variable.

### `readInput()`

- Checks if there is new serial data available.
  - If true, parses the input as `intensity`.
  - Prints the `intensity` to the serial monitor.
  - Updates the `state` variable based on the `intensity` value.

### `expesiveOperation()`

- Calls the `readInput()` function.
- This function can be used to perform any additional expensive operations related to the application.

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE or compatible software.
3. Copy the modified code and paste it into a new sketch.
4. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
5. Open the serial monitor to view the debug information.
6. Send intensity values (0-255) through the serial monitor to control the PWM signal.

Note: Make sure to set the line ending option in the serial monitor to "Newline" for proper input parsing.

## Customization

- Modify the `outPin` variable to use a different digital pin for the PWM output.
- Adjust the `intensity` range and corresponding `state` values to suit your application.
- Modify the `expesiveOperation()` function to include

 any additional operations required.

## Limitations

- The code assumes a single LED or output device connected to the `outPin` for simplicity. If you need to control multiple devices, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
- The code does not include any error checking or input validation for simplicity. Ensure that valid intensity values are sent through the serial monitor to avoid unexpected behavior.
